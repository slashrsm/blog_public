Since then I have planning to try to migrate <a href="/">my blog</a> from previous version of this great CMS. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/8">Drupal 8 comes with many improvements</a> and I definitely wanted to leverage those on my site as well.</p>

<p>Besides that, I always used my personal site as an experimental sandbox where I tested new Drupal modules, themes and technologies. Even if <a href="https://drupal.org/u/slashrsm">I am very active contributor</a> to Drupal core and contributed modules and I've been working on <a href="https://examiner.github.io/pubtool_session">an enterprise Drupal 8 project</a> at my work, I've never actually migrated a site to Drupal 8 to this date. It was definitely something I wanted to try.</p>

<p>A previous version of janezurevc.name was running on Drupal 7. It is important to note migration from 7 to 8 isn't officially supported yet. Drupal 7 won't reach EOL for at least few more years, which makes this migration not critical. However, migrations from Drupal 6 have been fully supported since the day 8 was released. 6 will reach EOL this month, which makes migration from 6 to 8 an absolute priority.</p>

<h2>Migration</h2>

<p>My site is actually very basic. I am using content (2 content types), taxonomy (1 vocabulary), few contributed modules and that is really it. It turns out that everything that I needed migrates reliably.</p>

<p>I started the process by reading <a href="https://www.drupal.org/upgrade/migrate">official documentation</a>. Besides <em>Migrate</em> and <em>Migrate Drupal</em> modules that come with core, I needed few contributed modules: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_upgrade">Drupal upgrade</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/project/migrate_tools">Migrate tools</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/">Migrate plus</a>.</p>

<p>Migration itself was extremely easy. I installed the Drupal 8 site, enabled migrate modules, started migration and waited for a few minutes. That's it! At least for core stuff. There are some glitches when it comes to contributed modules, but even those were fairly easy to resolve.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone that contributed to Migrate in Drupal core. You did an awesome job!</p>

<h2>Theme</h2>

<p>The Drupal 7 version of my blog used a <a href="https://drupal.org/proejct/sky">Sky theme</a>, which is unfortunately not ported to 8 yet. For that reason I needed to search the theme repository and came across the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/bootstrap_clean_blog">Bootstrap clean blog</a>.</p>

<figure role="group"><img src="../sites/default/files/attached-files/bcb/index.png" title="Bootstrap clean blog project page" /><figcaption>Bootstrap clean blog project page</figcaption></figure><p>It looked nice and it had a Drupal 8 -dev release. Regardless of that, it worked like a charm. I even contributed <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2663456">minor</a> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2663442">patches</a> and am planning to contribute a few more.</p>

<p><em>How do you like the theme?</em></p>

<h2>Modules</h2>

<p>Like almost every Drupal website out there mine also uses few contributed modules. Let's see how that went.</p>

<h3>Disqus</h3>

<p>The Disqus module has been ported as part of the <a href="../progress-entity-embed-module-gsoc-2014/">Google summer of code project</a>, which I mentored in 2014. The module itself works very well. We changed the architecture a bit; instead of having a custom database table, we instead used a dedicated field type. This approach comes with many benefits. By doing this we're not limited to nodes anymore. Disqus can be used on any entity type now.</p>

<figure role="group"><img src="../sites/default/files/attached-files/disqus/index.png" title="Disqus on 'Manage fields' page" /><figcaption>Disqus on 'Manage fields' page</figcaption></figure><p>Even if the port was there, migration was not. I used this opportunity to dig into this part of Drupal a bit more. I wrote a 7 to 8 migration support for everything Disqus needs. This includes general configuration, fields on entities, statuses and identifiers. My code is <a href="https://cgit.drupalcode.org/disqus/commit/?id=be0beb18637c1fbc6d7a246b385ef2ab8f586c8b">already committed</a> and you can give it a try.</p>

<p><em>Did you try Disqus migration? Let me know how it worked for you.</em></p>

<h2>Pathauto and Redirect</h2>

<p>D8 ports are available on <a href="https://drupal.org/project/pathauto">their</a> Drupal.org <a href="https://drupal.org/project/redirect">project</a> pages. They work great. While core migrates existing aliases, alias patterns, redirects and other configurations aren't supported yet. I had just 3 alias patterns and less than 10 redirects on my old site, so this wasn't hard to fix manually.</p>

<p>If you meet <a href="https://drupal.org/u/berdir">@Berdir</a> please buy him a beer. He did an awesome job porting this (any many other) modules.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>I was using media to embed images in WYSIWYG, which uses the legacy embed token in Drupal 7. This part was unfortunately not ported yet. I was using this in less than 10 places so I decided to fix this manually too. I used a simple SQL query to get node IDs of content that used the legacy token. Then I simply changed it to standard <img /> tag with data-entity-* attributes, which Drupal 8 uses for it's own image embeds.</p>

<h2>Markdown filter</h2>

<p>Recently I found out that I prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> when producing written content. It doesn't interfere with my writing flow nearly as much as WYSIWYG editors do. When using Markdown, I focus on content instead of the appearance (for the same reason I really liked <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> during my university years).</p>

<figure role="group"><img src="../sites/default/files/attached-files/markdown/index.png" title="This post being produced in Markdown" /><figcaption>This post being produced in Markdown</figcaption></figure><p>Guess what? There is a module for that! The <a href="https://drupal.org/project/markdown">Markdown filter</a> comes with a text filter that will convert Markdown syntax to HTML when displaying it. And it also has a Drupal 8 port. Download, install, configure, use. It was as easy as that!</p>

<p><em>How does Markdown work for you? Do you prefer it over the WYSIWYG editor as much as I do?</em></p>

<h2>Other modules</h2>

<p>I used a few other modules on the page. All of them have some kind of Drupal 8 release:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/honeypot">Honeypot</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/metatag">Metatag</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/simple_sitemap">Simple sitemap</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/google_analytics">Google analytics</a></li>
</ul><p>All of them work without any problem. I downloaded, installed and configured them. Google analytics even comes with support for migration (which meant the 3rd step was not needed).</p>

<p>Great work, maintainers and contributors!</p>

<h2>Other interesting stuff</h2>

<p>I also used this migration to move my blog to a new hosting solution. The old blog was hosted on a VPS that I had used in the past and am slowly moving away from. Most of my sites and services are currently hosted on a dedicated server at <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a> (they provide excellent value for the price, so I'd definitely recommend them).</p>

<p>Recently I started using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for my development environments and I wanted to try it in production too (I mentioned I am (ab)using my personal site for experimenting, right? :)). As a result of that I'm hosting <a href="/">janezurevc.name</a> in a Dockerized environment managed via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker compose</a>. Compose is super nice as it allows you to describe your infrastructure stack in a single YAML file. This allows you to commit it to a VCS repository and replicate infrastructure anywhere you want. <em>But this is already a topic planned for some of my future posts.</em></p>

<p><em>Did you try to migrate your Drupal 6 or 7 sites to 8? How did it go? Which contributed modules are you using?</em></p>
